# Defaut Google Scripts

## A bit of a FAQ ...

### Why those scripts ?

Hello @all ! I'm a french webmarketer, working A LOT around Google Scripts, mainly via Google Spreadsheet. I use them daily, for statistic purposes, fetch information my clients forget to tell me, etc.

Sure, a lot of them are available on Internet, but I wanted to create my own, face my own errors and mistakes, and maybe share a bit of this path with other interested people.

### Can I help ?

I'd be glad to watch those scripts being updated, upgraded, by anyone of you. Please, feel free to contribute, give advice and share thoughts.

### Can I use them ?

Feel to use them for your private purpose, but please, respect any author and contibutor, and leave the comment areas in the files.
